## A simple, lightweight distribution

You've reached the website for **Arch Linux** , a lightweight and flexible
LinuxÂ® distribution that tries to Keep It Simple.

Currently we have official packages optimized for the x86-64 architecture. We
complement our official package sets with a [ community-operated package
repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/ "Arch User Repository \(AUR\)") that
grows in size and quality each and every day.

Our strong community is diverse and helpful, and we pride ourselves on the
range of skillsets and uses for Arch that stem from it. Please check out our
[forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/ "Arch Forums") and [mailing
lists](https://lists.archlinux.org/ "Arch Mailing Lists") to get your feet
wet. Also glance through our [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/ "Arch Wiki")
if you want to learn more about Arch.

####  [mkinitcpio hook migration and early microcode](/news/mkinitcpio-hook-
migration-and-early-microcode/ "View full article: mkinitcpio hook migration
and early microcode")

2024-03-04

With the release of [mkinitcpio
v38](https://lists.archlinux.org/hyperkitty/list/arch-
projects@lists.archlinux.org/thread/PZHWLVJLN5EPW6EVK2HEKVBDBNZWHREN/),
several hooks previously provided by Arch packages have been moved to the
mkinitcpio upstream project. The hooks are: systemd, udev, encrypt, sd-
encrypt, lvm2 and mdadm_udev.

To ensure no breakage of users' setup occurs, temporary conflicts have been
introduced into the respective packages to prevent installing packages that
are no longer compatible.

The following packages needs to be upgraded together:

  * mkinitcpio 38-3
  * systemd 255.4-2
  * lvm2 2.03.23-3
  * mdadm 4.3-2
  * cryptsetup 2.7.0-3

Please note that the `mkinitcpio` flag `--microcode`, and the `microcode`
option in the preset files, has been deprecated in favour of a new `microcode`
hook. This also allows you to drop the microcode `initrd` lines from your boot
configuration as they are now packed together with the main initramfs image.

####  [Making dbus-broker our default D-Bus daemon](/news/making-dbus-broker-
our-default-d-bus-daemon/ "View full article: Making dbus-broker our default
D-Bus daemon")

2024-01-09

We are making `dbus-broker` our default implementation of D-Bus, for improved
performance, reliability and integration with systemd.

For the foreseeable future we will still support the use of `dbus-daemon`, the
previous implementation. Pacman will ask you whether to install `dbus-broker-
units` or `dbus-daemon-units`. We recommend picking the default.

For a more detailed rationale, please see our [RFC
25](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/rfcs/-/blob/master/rfcs/0025-dbus-
broker-default.rst).

####  [Bugtracker migration to GitLab completed](/news/bugtracker-migration-
to-gitlab-completed/ "View full article: Bugtracker migration to GitLab
completed")

2023-12-03

We are happy to announce that the [migration of the bugtracker to
GitLab](https://lists.archlinux.org/hyperkitty/list/arch-dev-
public@lists.archlinux.org/thread/WYXDTJ3TR2DWRQCDZK44BQDH67IDVGTS/) is done!
ðŸ¥³

Thanks to everyone who has helped during the migration!

This means the issue tracker and merge requests on the GitLab package repos
are now enabled.

The old bugtracker will subsequently be closed down. For archiving reasons
there will be a static copy so that links (for example the randomly picked
[Task #56716](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/56716)) are still stable,
migrated bugs have a closing comment pointing to the new URL on GitLab.

Packaging bugs are now opened on the repo hosting the corresponding packaging
sources, the "Add â€¦

####  [Incoming changes in JDK / JRE 21 packages may require manual
intervention](/news/incoming-changes-in-jdk-jre-21-packages-may-require-
manual-intervention/ "View full article: Incoming changes in JDK / JRE 21
packages may require manual intervention")

2023-11-02

We are introducing a change in JDK/JRE packages of our distro. This is
triggered from the way a JRE is build in modern versions of Java (>9). We are
introducing this change in Java 21.

To sum it up instead of having JDK and JRE packages coexist in the same system
we will be making them conflict. The JDK variant package includes the runtime
environment to execute Java applications so if one needs compilation and
runtime of Java they need only the JDK package in the future. If, on the other
hand, they need just runtime of Java then JRE â€¦

####  [Changes to default password hashing algorithm and umask
settings](/news/changes-to-default-password-hashing-algorithm-and-umask-
settings/ "View full article: Changes to default password hashing algorithm
and umask settings")

2023-09-22

With _shadow_ >= `4.14.0`, Arch Linux's default password hashing algorithm
changed from **SHA512** to [**yescrypt**](https://www.openwall.com/yescrypt/).

Furthermore, the [`umask`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/umask.1p) settings
are now configured in `/etc/login.defs` instead of `/etc/profile`.

This should not require any manual intervention.

## Reasons for Yescrypt

The password-based key derivation function (KDF) and password hashing scheme
**yescrypt** has been chosen due to its adoption (readily available in
_libxcrypt_ , which is used by [_pam_](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PAM))
and its stronger resilience towards password cracking attempts over
**SHA512**.

Although the winner of the [Password Hashing
Competition](https://www.password-hashing.net/) has been **argon2** , this
algorithm is not yet available in _libxcrypt â€¦_
